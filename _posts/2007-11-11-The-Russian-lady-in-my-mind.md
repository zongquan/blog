# The Russian lady in my mind

"Science and Technology is the first Productivity!" our famous leader Deng had ever said that. No Science and Technology, and no Economics.

​    Yesterday afternoon, without going to library, I logged on my ICQ to find some foreigners to chat for improving my English. I'm very glad to meet someone whose name was absolutely like Chinese character which attracted me and made me thought she was a Chinese too. So I added her into my friend group. When I asked her whether was a Chinese lady or not. She denied and said she was a Russian. And this time I recognized that it's not only the Japan using Chinese character but also Russia. I'm very proud of it.

​    When we talk about our own country's economics, she was very sad and a little sorrow. She told me that at this time Russia was not richer than before, cause of the economy passed away about 40 years. Then I said "Science and Technology is the first productivity and no Science and Technology no economics", I also said that our country had set up a satellite which would go around the moon. But she looked not very interested. Then I continued. When I was a very young boy, I just knew there was a biggest country whose society was same as China in the world, which had strong Technology and Military, which had big power to struggle with America, which we were all proud of, named Russia. Finally, she told me the true, "Yeah, our Technology and Military was very strong in the past, and we set up the first satellite in the universe" "But who mind peoples?" When I heard this, my tears almost skip out. Who mind peoples?

​    Looking around our own country, how many peoples in our country had ever ever been hungry and thirsty, I don't know. What the thousands million Yuan satellite around the moon bring? I also don't know. But one thing I know, the Science and Technology is the first productivity, that's absolutely true.

​    In the end, the Russian lady said "and this time we Russian are more happiness than before."

​    It made me remember a movie named Brave Heart. So I put the movie's main song in the end. I hoped everyone like it and listen it seriously.
